<hr>

<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> as a Senior UI Engineer on the Insight Engineering team. We build applications to give other engineers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insight</a> into how their software is operating. It's a pretty chill job.</p>

<p>Outside of the office, I help maintain the QUnit testing framework and dabble in Open Source software from time-to-time. You can follow me here or on <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmwillis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to hear my musings about web development, the tech industry, and obscure music.</p>
