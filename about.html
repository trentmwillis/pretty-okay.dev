  <div class="about-description">
    <p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> as a Senior UI Engineer on the Insight Engineering team. We build applications to give other engineers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insight</a> into how their software is operating. It's a pretty chill job.</p>

    <p>Outside of the office, I help maintain the <a href="http://qunitjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QUnit</a> testing framework, dabble in other <a href="https://github.com/trentmwillis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Source</a> software from time-to-time, and <a href="./speaking">speak</a> at tech conferences. You can follow me here or on <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmwillis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to hear my musings about web development, the tech industry, and obscure music.</p>

    <p>If you want to chat, feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> or send me a DM on Twitter.</p>
