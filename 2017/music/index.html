      <p class="banner-byline">by <a href="/about">Trent Willis</a></p>
      <p class="banner-description">
          Every year I like to reflect on the music that was the most impactful to me. I used to do this by picking an "album of the year".
          <br>
          <br>
          Several years ago, however, I realized that trying to pick an "album of the year" or a list of the "best" albums led me to write and reflect on the albums that I thought were musically "good" or relevant to the alternative music scene, and not necessarily the albums that played an important role in my life that year.
          <br>
          <br>
          So, for the past few years, I have put together "music journeys" instead; lists of songs from various albums that I listened to a lot over the course of the year. I arrange the songs chronologically by when they entered my library, so the only reflection that has to happen is whether I thought the song was important to me and when I started listening to it.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is my first year sharing one of these lists and I hope you enjoy the peek into my life and what music has been important to me this year.

        youtubeId: "dZ9JVxQVQy4",
        review: "The year kicked off in a big way with Code Orange releasing what would become a Grammy-nominated album. I had been excited for this album since I heard it announced, as I loved their previous record, I Am King. The album's opener and title track, is a perfect example of the band's dark and industrial blend of metal and hardcore. I don't think a single week went by this year where I did not listen to the majority of this album."

        youtubeId: "tJJHz-WE3Ao",
        review: "Advent's last album was released in 2009 which is more than the lifetime of most hardcore bands. So, when the band announced they would be releasing a new album last year, I was shocked to say the least. To say Advent are underrated would be a gross understatement; the band plays some of the most relentless, but quality, hardcore music I know of and yet they remain virtually unknown."

        artist: "Ocean Grove",
        song: "Intimate Alien",
        youtubeId: "T2LO5FyASDU",
        review: "Ocean Grove is an odd band. In fact, they even refer to their music as \"odd world music\", which amounts to a mixture of nu-metal, metalcore, and whatever else they feel like throwing in. They also lean heavily into a Mad Max aesthetic. Overall, while this never quite made it into heavy rotation, some of the songs, such as Intimate Alien, I have repeatedly come back to over the course of the year."

        youtubeId: "H5FBvGpgGWg",
        review: "I'm fairly sure I listened to this entire album somewhere near 30 times in the first week I picked it up. While it didn't really push the boundaries of the genre much, Incendiary are, in my opinion, the current kings of New York hardcore. It is political, hard, and unapologetic. No blast beats or screaming here, just straight-up hardcore."

        youtubeId: "qhuu0PIB8A0",

        youtubeId: "y0ZIj27Km3U",
        review: "Gideon's Milestone was one of the first albums that got me into the more \"hardcore\" side of metalcore. So it was a big disappointment to me when their last album just never really clicked with my tastes. That said, I didn't give up and gave Cold a listen when it finally released. This album finds the perfect spot between their original metallic hardcore sound and their more recent nu-metalcore sound. The lead single, Champions, I felt exemplified this. Seeing them play it live at Facedown Fest this year reminded me of why I enjoyed the band in the first place."

        song: "Whether Terrified Or Unafraid",
        youtubeId: "3nOic5O6qvE",
        review: "I have an odd relationship with '68. I enjoy and appreciate their music, but I have to be in a particular mood to want to listen to it. When Two Parts Viper dropped, it was probably several months before I made it past the first few tracks. Thankfully, those first few tracks are gold. Whether Terrified Or Unafraid is one of the best examples of the myriad aspects of this band's sound. It's raw-sounding rock that has an experimental yet restrained feeling to it. Oh, and it's a blast to hear live."

        song: "Self Supremacy",
        youtubeId: "E069_0MShkI",
        review: "Malevolence is a band that I had not heard of until Code Orange took them on tour this year. I am so glad they did. The band's fusion of beatdown hardcore and metal with some southern rock influences was something I would have never expected from a European band, but it is money. The album is relentlessly hard and heavy with a load of groovy riffs and breakdowns."

        artist: "Cold War Kids",
        song: "Restless",
        youtubeId: "dd8-wjXIoVo",
        review: "This album stands out for me this year, because it is so poppy. Cold War Kids' album Robbers & Cowards is one of my favorite albums of all time, but sadly they haven't ever released anything else that stuck with me over the years. L.A. Divine might change that. While it is a huge departure from Robbers & Cowards, I felt that the album was more inviting and less derivative than their other recent work. While it is definitely more commercialized, that isn't always a bad thing. Plus, it's just so much fun to singalong to."

        youtubeId: "a1MKhpxbhrg",
        review: "I've listened to this whole album probably hundreds of times this year. The lyrics hit that rare blend of catchy, relatable and slightly humorous at points. The music is pretty solid (pop-)punk as well and fronted by the singer from Protest The Hero, whose voice I love. All-in-all, this is just a fantastically enjoyable and pretty unknown album that has made my commute better on many occassions."

        youtubeId: "XKaS-TM1gUc",
        review: "This album had so much hype that I had to check it out. This song is loads of fun with lots of breakdowns and a catchy chorus. The music video in particular stood out because it hits on an issue that is important to me and my wife: girls in the hardcore/metal scene. It is refreshing to see a prominent band in the scene promoting and encouraging crowd paticipation from women. Because of this, plus the insane catchiness, this song has been a frequent jam for me and my wife."

        youtubeId: "9ag2RyDdBWU",
        review: "After seeing Volumes last year and the ridiculous amount of crowd participation, I made sure to check out their new album this year. Different Animals is a super enjoyable ride of djent-y nu-metal that is leaps ahead of their previous work in terms of production quality. So when we got to see them again this year with Issues, I was super pumped and it turned out to be one of the most memorable shows of the year."

        review: "Every now and then I go on a prog music bender. This year, it started with this phenomenal EP by Eternity Forever, who are essentially a supergroup of members from Dance Gavin Dance, Strawberry Girls, and CHON. The music is a soulful blend of prog and indie rock that really evokes memories of driving down the California coast or relaxing days at the beach. While the EP is rather short, it feels totally fine to just put it on repeat for long stretches of time."

        youtubeId: "ftf961GlTbw",
        review: "Continuing into my prog rock bender, this album came as a complete surprise to me. I discovered it via a YouTube recommendation and am super glad it popped up. The album is a collection of really great instrumental music that manages to uses common melodies and motifs from anime soundtracks. Not to mention the title of the EP is hilarious. All-in-all, this spoke to me on multiple levels, as a music lover, as an anime nerd, and as a fan of corny internet jokes."

        youtubeId: "ppO1TXmfpeA",
        review: "Metalcore with deathcore tendencies is how I would describe Currents. Their music is way more polished and accessible than most deathcore bands out there, but they still manage to keep it heavy and musically in realms that most metalcore bands won't venture. The lyrics are also really compelling at moments and I find myself often singing along to the songs as they play. I was interested in the album before it came out, super stoked once I got to listen to it, and now firmly can say that this was a big part of music for me this year."

        youtubeId: "XAm064U4Czk",
        review: "I started listening to Varials sometime last year and immediately knew I loved their music. The band's sound is heavy as hell but with some really nice grooves to it as well; they fit into that niche of metalcore that takes cues from the beatdown scene, ala Kublai Khan or Knocked Loose, but still their own. Seeing them earlier this year with Wage War and Gideon was a treat as they were one of the few bands I've seen who will still get down in the pit and bang their heads to the other bands that performed that night."

        review: "I really don't think Wage War is that special of a band when it comes to metalcore, but their music is just ridiculously fun to jam and mosh to. On Deadweight, I don't think any song exemplifies that as much as Southbound, which is basically just a 3-minute long alternation between catchy, singalong choruses and moshable breakdowns."

        review: "The most brutal song on this list? Very likely this one. I like a handful of Thy Art Is Murder's songs and this just happened to be one of them. The opening of Slaves Beyond Death just caught my ear instantly and the vocal and riffy interplay is interesting enough to have me capture for the length of the song. There were a few other gems on Dear Desolation that made it a worthwhile download and as a result, my year wouldn't be complete without mentioning it."

        review: "I've been a big fan of Crossfaith for a long time now (since MySpace days) and yet they had fallen out of my rotation in the past year. But, with their new EP, that changed. At only 3 songs long, the EP still had a lot of variety and the title track, Freedom, exemplified it the most. The song epitomizes most of the aspects of the band's sound that I love with the addition of Rou Reynold's from Enter Shikari doing a gust spot. It's phenomenal, even if it comes across as a bit cliche during Rou's rap."

The band's emo-leaning alt-rock sound appealed to my mid-2000's nostalgia and got me hooked. After catching a brief portion of their set at Warped, I knew I had to download the album and subsequently learned virtually every lyric on it. It's just so good."

        review: "This album is blistering. I went into it knowing next to nothing about the band and was pleasantly surprised. The hardcore style is closer to Advent than anything else on this list, but still different, in large part due to Brendan Murphy's vocal delivery. While just an EP, almost every song from the record has seen significant play time from me for the last several months."

        review: "With this past year in United States politics, it is only natural that Stray From The Path released what is quite possibly their most controversial and in your face record yet. In typical (and enjoyable) fashion, they deliver a heavy, New York influenced take on rap-infused hardcore. While not my favorite album by them, it certainly has some seriously banging tracks on it. The opener is no exception. It's short, sweet, and likely to make the kids lose their shit (I also realized, I'm old enough now to say this)."

        review: "This album blew me away. I was not a huge fan of their past works that I had listened to, but this album just connects so much better for me. The vocals are crisper, the songs more varied, and that combination just drives home the aggressive driving brand of hardcore that Counterparts is known for. Bouquet is a perfect example of this as the leading track after the intro that absolutely launches the album straight into high gear. It's so good, which has made it quite difficult to give the back-half of the albums as much attention unfortunately."

        review: "I was really unsure how I felt about this album upon listening to it. The album has much stronger pop and electronic elements than their previous works which often borrowed heavily from post-hardcore and punk influences. That said, it is very much in keeping with the bands genre-defying modus operandi and is really catchy throughout most of it. The Sights I feel is the best representation of this new Enter Shikari; it's poppy, catchy and yet still edgy enough that it is unlikely to ever see radio play in the States."

I've been a fan of Kublai Khan for a while now, but their last album was underwhelming to me after the absolutely incredible Balancing Survival And Happiness. This album, however, sees them coming back into form with some more interesting song structures than in the past, though lyrically it leaves something to be desired. Anyway, The Hammer has been my go to jam for lifting heavy things since it was released and shows no signs of going away anytime soon."

        review: "The day August Burns Red releases an album I don't enjoy will likely be when I decide to stop listening to metal. Which will probably also be when I die. Joking aside, this album may be my favorite release of theirs since Constellations (which is huge). It feels much more cohesive than their last few albums, which often contained progressive elements that felt a little forced to me; on Phantom Anthem they feel natural. Invisible Enemy is a perfect example of this, as it blends their signature metalcore sound with some East Asian influences and even is reminiscent of their older work on Messengers. Oh, and it was nominated for a Grammy, so that's impressive."

        review: "I've been a huge fan of The Ongoing Concept since their pre-record-label days, so it was a big disappoint to me to see almost all the members of the band leave between their last album and this one. To say I was skeptical of it, would be a drastic understatement. That said, when I finally gave this single a listen, I was sold. The band still retains much of their original sound, but with slightly more experimentation (which is straneg, cause this band was already pretty out there). In particular, the album is highly self-referential which is really incredible. The music video for this song actually contains references to all their past music videos, which makes everything feel more connected to their previous works even with the lineup change."

However, after seeing them play at Worthwhile's farewell show and seeing how into it the crowd was, I felt I needed to give their new album a chance. In short, this album became one of my favorites of the year. Every song in the album is lovely, but Daylily stands out to me due to its lyrical themes and the alternating mellow and upbeat interplay of emo and pop-punk elements. If you, or anyone you know, has ever dealt with depression, this song will likely hit you hard."

The band's sound is in many ways reminiscent of a blend of Circa Survive and Dance Gavin Dance, in the best ways possible. The proggy guitar riffs mixed with alternating soaring and blistering vocals satisfies both my love for dissonant and melodic music at the same time. In short, after listening to this opening track just once, I regretted not listening to this band sooner."

        review: "The first album by We Came As Romans was a big part of my senior (?) year of high school. So, it was always unfortunate that the bands albums since then didn't really ever catch my interest. Cold Like War, however, changed that. It has the same sort of blend of heavy, catchy, and unique that To Plant A Seed had without sounding they're just doing the same thing. Wasted Age in particular I feel represents how the band has evolved, yet still has many of the same elements that caused me to fall in love with the first album."

This song is technically off the deluxe edition release of Unfamiliar, but I think it is the best song on the album. It doesn't push any genre boundaries; it is simply catchy and slightly angsty pop-punk. While this was a late addition to my music collection this year, I already know most of the words to many songs on the album which means it will likely be getting play time well into the New Year."
