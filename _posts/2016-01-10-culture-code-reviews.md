We've all heard that [workplace culture is important](http://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-culture-is-important-2013-1) and, with the experience of my relatively short career, I can attest to that fact. I've had numerous lunch-table discussions about company culture ranging from the now-clich√© [bashing of Silicon Valley lavishness](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-lavish-silicon-valley-perks-could-be-bad-for-workers-2013-7) to singing praises of [how awesome LinkedIn's culture is](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-LinkedIn-RVW5492270.htm). 

However, one thing I feel is almost always missing from these discussions and articles is a focus on the minutia; the minor details that really define a company's culture. We talk about culture in trendy terms like "startup culture" or "a culture of transformation" and like to equate awesome perks, such as free food, with a vibrant company.

On the day-to-day though, these "easy targets" don't really define a company's culture. Sure, they can be contributing factors, but culture is a manifestation of the beliefs and customs of a company. You don't have a culture of transformation by having a culture of transformation; you have it by acting in a such a way that transformation manifests itself. Let's look at one way this breaks down practically.

## Culture Minutia: _Code Reviews_

Recently, I've had quite a few talks with various co-workers and superiors about different aspects of the Web Development culture at LinkedIn. One of the topics that comes up frequently in these conversations is around our process of code reviews.

For those of you unfamiliar with software development, code review is the process through which we get peers to review the code we've written for things such as style, correctness, and completeness. It's a topic which has been [talked to death](https://www.google.com/search?q=code+reviews) with many differing opinions.

A process as mundane as reviewing code is not something you'll likely hear highlighted as part of a company's culture. And yet, for any tech company, it is [almost definitely a part of their culture](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/310813/how-do-you-perform-code-reviews).

You see, the reason this area keeps appearing in our discussions is that how our developers approach code reviews speaks volumes about how they view their roles (_are they learning during the process or doing it because they have to?_), what they think about craftsmanship (_are they concerned with quality code?_), and how they interact with their team (_do they try to sneak code in late at night or do they wait for good feedback?_).

All these aspects help make up the culture. I, for one, want code reviews to encourage our developers to learn during the process, to strive for quality code, and to build constructive relationships between team members.

## Culture Is Dynamic, Not Static

What this all means, for me at least, is that company culture is tremendously dynamic and that is a good thing.

In the year and a half that I've been at LinkedIn I've seen the web development culture change in many subtle and some not-so-subtle ways. I picture all these cultural factors functioning in a way similar to [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life); they are constantly in play with each other, with various aspects of the culture coming to life or dying over time. It's not a couple big, inflexible initiatives, but a bunch of small, day-to-day things that make up your culture.

This is good and exciting because it means that you constantly have opportunities to revisit and reenergize the culture at your company, but it also means that we need to give attention to all the things that make up company culture. Care for and support those things that you feel contribute to making it great and look for alternatives to those that you feel could be improved.

After all, the culture is only as good as those that contribute to it.
