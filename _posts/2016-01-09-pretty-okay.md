We've all heard that [workplace culture is important](http://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-culture-is-important-2013-1) and in my short time out of college I can attest to this fact. I've had countless lunch-table discussions about company culture ranging from the standard [bashing of Silicon Valley lavishness](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-lavish-silicon-valley-perks-could-be-bad-for-workers-2013-7) to singing praises of [how awesome LinkedIn's culture is](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-LinkedIn-RVW5492270.htm). 

However, one thing I feel is almost always missing from these discussion and articles is the minutia; the minor details that really define a company's culture. We talk about culture in trendy terms like "startup culture" or "culture of transformation" and like to equate awesome perks, such as free food, with a healthy company culture. On the day-to-day though, these things don't really define a company's culture.

## Culture Minutia: _Code Reviews_

Recently, I've had quite a few talks with various co-workers and superiors about different aspects of the Web Development culture at LinkedIn. One of the topics that comes up frequently in these conversations is around our process of code reviews.

For those of you unfamiliar with software development, code reviews are the process through which we get peers to review code for things such as style, correctness, and completeness. Its a topic which has been [talked to death](https://www.google.com/search?q=code+reviews) with many differing opinions.

## Happiness Is Dynamic, Not Static

A corrolary to this whole culture discussion is the happiness of employees. Obviously, the primary goal of improving workplace culture for most companies is to increase job satisfaction and happiness amongst your employees. Yet, when we talk about happiness, we usually ask questions such as "are you happy with x?"

This belies an insidious truth for many companies: you don't need to improve something if no one is complaining about it.

So while maybe your code review process isn't causing headaches for your developers yet, it is never too early to make sure there aren't improvements to be made.

Sure, transformation may be an outcome of the culture and free food helps me focus on my daily tasks, but these sorely miss the things I love about the culture.
